# This Task is made with CodeIgniter 4 Framework

## My Notes For Reviewer

- Run this command on the public folder to start the server "php -S localhost:8888".
- Do not run the project form xampp htdocs folder it will overwrite the ajax url by prefixing it with public/.
- Create new database named "paytabs" OR enter your connection config in app/config/database.php.
- There is a migration & seeder file for the table run the migrate && seed command just once OR if you want to i will attach the database  sql file just import it. it's located in public/sql/db.sql.
- Internet connection required for the cdns.
- Controller name -> CategoriesController.php | model name -> Category | views in /categories path.

## BIG NOTE: It's My First Time Working With Codeignitor :)
